# Finance_Project

These scrapers are part of a project under the supervision of Prof. Venkat Venkatasubramanian.
Currently the NASDAQ Wayback Machine scraper works as intended, but it is very delicate and will be prone to change.
The Yahoo Finance scraper is currently under development but should be done soon.

These scrapers are very rudimentary, and there are probably more efficient ways for scraping, but for the purposes of these projects it is unlikely I will invest much time to optimize them.
